These are a few steps that should be taken before releasing a Starexec distribution. This mostly consists
of deleting the few files that users do not need-- files that may contain Starexec passwords or which are
used only to deploy Starexec on our specific systems.

1) Remove org/starexec/config/starexec-config.xml and rename starexec-config-deploy.xml to starexec-config.xml.

2) Delete the files 'production.properties' and 'stardev.properties'

3) In the scripts-common directory, delete the stardeploy.sh, starjobs.sh, and updateSQL scripts.

4) Delete the local-properties directory.

5) Under sql/new-install, delete the MinimalData.sql file and rename MinimalDataDistribute.sql to MinimalData.sql.

6) Delete the local-lib directory

7) Delete the utility-scripts directory

8) Delete this file.


The file createDeployArchive.sh creates an archive and performs all of these steps automatically.
This file will be generated whenever you build the project using Ant.
