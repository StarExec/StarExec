<h1>Community Statistics</h1>

<p>The Community Statistics compares communities based on number of:
users, solvers, benchmarks, jobs, job pairs, and disk usage.

</p>

<h2>Notes on statistics</h2>

<p>Entities are counted as belonging to a community
if they appear in at least one of its subspaces.  All entities are uniquely 
counted by id.  Since copying primitives results in new ids, those copied primitives are counted as unique entities.
</p>

<p>Disk usage is the total disk space used by solvers and benchmarks in a community
</p>

<h2>Notes on fetching data</h2>

<p>The information needed to complete the statistics page requires searching and counting through
all users, solvers, benchmarks, jobs, and job pairs.  Because of the scope of this task, we don't always query
the database for this information.  Instead, after a database query, we save that information and set an arbitrary minimum time that must pass
before we requery the database.  If the statistics page is requested before the minimum time has passed, we simply display the old information that we saved.  
This means that sometimes the statistics page loads up very quickly and sometimes it might take a while.
