<h1>Exploring spaces</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The space explorer is the main page for viewing the space hierarchy
on StarExec.  With it, you can view spaces and their contents, which
can be subspaces, solvers, benchmarks, and users.  If you are not in a
space, you will not be able to see it.  Permissions control whether
you can make certain kinds of modifications to spaces.  See the
actions at the very bottom of the right part of the page, for things
you can do in a particular space. </p>

<h2>Creating spaces</h2>

<p>To create a new subspace of a space for which you have permission to
add spaces (for example, your personal space in a community you have
joined), select "add subspace" from the list of actions at the bottom
of the space explorer page.  When adding a subspace, there are several
options you can set.  There are default permissions, which users added
to the space will receive automatically (and can be changed later, as
described below).  One can also choose to inherit all the users of the
parent space, to become members of the new subspace.  If you choose
the sticky leaders option, then you will always be added as a leader
of any subspace created below the current one, even if another user
(which you have granted permissions for adding subspaces) creates it.
</p>

<h2>Modifying spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Copying primitives.</strong>
To copy primitives (users, solvers, benchmarks, or jobs), select them
from the main panel of the space explorer, and then drag them to the
desired space in the tree view on the left part of the page.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Deleting and removing jobs.</strong>
	To remove a job from a space (without deleting it), drag and drop the job
	to the trashbin on the right hand side of the page and select "remove jobs".
	A removed job is still visible from Account->Profile.
	To delete a job you must own the job. Drag and drop the job to the trashbin and
	select "delete permanently". The job and all results contained in the job will
	be deleted permanently.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Deleting and removing benchmarks.</strong>
	Similarly to jobs, benchmarks can be deleted or removed by dragging them
	to the trashbin. Selecting "remove from space" will remove them from the space but not
	delete them. Selecting "move to recycle bin" will delete the benchmark and move it to your
	recycle bin accessible from your Account->Profile, removed benchmarks are also available at
	Account->Profile.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Deleting and removing solvers.</strong>
	Deleting a solver is the same as deleting a benchmark. Removing a solver is the same with only
	one difference. When removing a solver you'll have the option to "remove from space hierarchy"
	this option allows you to remove the solver from the space as well as all descendant spaces.
</p>
<p>
	<strong>Deleting and removing subspaces.</strong>
	To delete a subspace, drag and drop it to the trashbin. The "remove subspaces only" option
	will delete the subspace and descendant subspaces but your primitives will still be accessible
	from Account->Profile. The remove subspaces and recycle primitives" option will delete the subspace
	and descendant subspaces and recycle your primitives in those spaces. The recycled primitives can be
	restored from your recycle bin.
</p>

<p><strong>Changing permissions.</strong>
If you are a space leader (typically if you created a space), you
can change the permissions a user in your space has for modifying that
space.  To do this, move your mouse over the user in the list of users
shown in the main panel of the space explorer page.  A tooltip menu
should pop up, which you can use to set the permissions for the user.</p>

<p>By default, when a user is added to a space, they receive the default
permissions for the space.  As space leader, you can set these default
permissions when the space is created.  You can also change them by
selecting "edit space" from the list of actions at the bottom of the
space explorer page.</p>
