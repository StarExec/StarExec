	<p id="advisory">Starexec is a cross community logic solving service under
		development at the University of Iowa under the direction of principal
		investigators Aaron Stump (Iowa), Geoff Sutcliffe (University
		of Miami), and Cesare Tinelli (Iowa).</p>
	<p>Our goal is to provide a shared logic solving infrastructure to
		researchers to manage benchmark libraries, community membership, and
		provide solver execution on a large cluster and facilitate translation
		between logics.</p>

	<p>
		Development details can be found on our <a
			href="http://wiki.uiowa.edu/display/stardev/Home">public
			development wiki</a>. We ran our first public events Summer 2013 (CoCo 2013 and SMT-EVAL 2013), 
                        and plan to run many more Summer 2014.
	</p>

	<p>
		We are funded by a $1.85 million USD grant from the National Science
		Foundation, the details of which can be found <a
