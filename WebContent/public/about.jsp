	<p id="advisory">StarExec is a cross community logic solving service
	developed at the University of Iowa under the direction of principal
	investigators Aaron Stump (Iowa), Geoff Sutcliffe (University
	of Miami), and Cesare Tinelli (Iowa).
  </p>
	
	<p>Its main goal is to facilitate the experimental evaluation of logic
	solvers, broadly understood as automated tools based on formal reasoning.
	The service is designed to provide a single piece of storage and computing
	infrastructure to logic solving communities and their members. 
	It aims at reducing duplication of effort and resources as well as 
	enabling individual researchers or groups with no access to comparable
	 infrastructure. 
	</p>
	
	<p>StarExec allows 
	<ul>
	<li>community organizers to store, manage and make available
	benchmark libraries;
	</li>
	<li>competition organizers to run logic solver competitions; and 
	</li>
	</li>community members to perform comparative evaluations of logic solvers 
	on public or private benchmark problems.
	</p>

	<p>The first public events ran on StarExec in Summer 2013 (CoCo 2013 and SMT-EVAL 2013). 
  Several more will run in Summer 2014.
	</p>

	<p>See <a href="machine-specs.txt">here</a> for machine specifications for the compute nodes.</p>

	<p>Use of StarExec is bound by the following
