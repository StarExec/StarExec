<star:template title="StarExec" css="about">

  <p id="advisory">StarExec is a cross community logic solving service
    developed at the University of Iowa and the University of Miami
        under the direction of principal
    investigators Aaron Stump (Iowa), Geoff Sutcliffe (University
    of Miami), and Cesare Tinelli (Iowa).
  </p>

  <p>Its main goal is to facilitate the experimental evaluation of logic
    solvers, broadly understood as automated tools based on formal
    reasoning. The service is designed to provide a single piece of storage
    and computing infrastructure to logic solving communities and their
    members. It aims at reducing duplication of effort and resources as well
    as enabling individual researchers or groups with no access to
    comparable infrastructure.
  </p>

  <p>StarExec allows </p>
  <ul>
    <li>community organizers to store, manage and make available
      benchmark libraries;
    </li>
    <li>competition organizers to run logic solver competitions; and
    <li>
      community members to perform comparative evaluations of logic
      solvers on public or private benchmark problems.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>See <a href="machine-specs.txt">here</a> for the machine 
       specifications for
    the compute nodes at the University of Iowa, and

        for the compute nodes at the University of Miami.</p>

  <p>A virtual machine for StarExec is <a
      href="https://www.starexec.org/vmimage/">here</a>. It is recommended
    to upgrade to the latest <a
        href="http://www.virtualbox.org">VirtualBox</a> for this
    (confirmed working for version 4.3.24).</p>

  <p>Use of StarExec is bound by the following

  <p>StarExec was first supported by a US$2.11 million grant from the
    National Science Foundation, the details of which can be found
