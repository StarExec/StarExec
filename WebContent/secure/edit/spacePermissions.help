<h1>Editing permissions</h1>

<p>Only space leaders are allowed to change permissions. Space
leaders are allowed to change anyone's permissions, even other space leaders.  The
only exception to this rule is the admin.  No one can change the admin's permissions.
</p>

<h2>How to make changes</h2>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Navigate to the <a href="/${starexecRoot}/secure/edit/spacePermissions.jsp">edit permissions page</a></li>
<li>Select the desired space where the change should take place</li>
<li>Select a user from the list of users that appears.</li>
<li>You should see a table called "change permissions" appear.  If instead you see a table called "selected user permissions", then you are not a space leader and you can't change permissions in this space.</li>
<li>Check or uncheck any permissions you want to change.  Click reset to reset the checkmarks to the user's original permissions.</li>
<li>Click save to save permission changes.</li>
<li>Decide if you want the changes to take place only in the selected space or hierarchically (relative to selected space).</li>
</ol>
<p>
