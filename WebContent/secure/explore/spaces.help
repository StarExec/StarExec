<h1>Exploring spaces</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The space explorer is the main page for viewing the space hierarchy
on StarExec.  With it, you can view spaces and their contents, which
can be subspaces, solvers, benchmarks, and users.  If you are not in a
space, you will not be able to see it.  Permissions control whether
you can make certain kinds of modifications to spaces.  See the
actions at the very bottom of the right part of the page, for things
you can do in a particular space. </p>

<h2>Creating spaces</h2>

<p>To create a new subspace of a space for which you have permission to
add spaces (for example, your personal space in a community you have
joined), select "add subspace" from the list of actions at the bottom
of the space explorer page.  When adding a subspace, there are several
options you can set.  There are default permissions, which users added
to the space will receive automatically (and can be changed later, as
described below).  One can also choose to inherit all the users of the
parent space, to become members of the new subspace.  If you choose
the sticky leaders option, then you will always be added as a leader
of any subspace created below the current one, even if another user
(which you have granted permissions for adding subspaces) creates it.
</p>

<h2>Modifying spaces</h2>

<p><strong>Copying primitives.</strong>
To copy primitives (users, solvers, benchmarks, or jobs), select them
from the main panel of the space explorer, and then drag them to the
desired space in the tree view on the left part of the page.</p>

<p><strong>Changing permissions.</strong>
If you are a space leader (typically if you created a space), you
can change the permissions a user in your space has for modifying that
space.  To do this, move your mouse over the user in the list of users
shown in the main panel of the space explorer page.  A tooltip menu
should pop up, which you can use to set the permissions for the user.</p>

<p>By default, when a user is added to a space, they receive the default
permissions for the space.  As space leader, you can set these default
permissions when the space is created.  You can also change them by
selecting "edit space" from the list of actions at the bottom of the
space explorer page.</p>
